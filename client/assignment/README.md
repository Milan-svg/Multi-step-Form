1. For this Multi-step Product Form, I have used redux for Form State Management, as well as React Hook Form for managing form data at each step.
2. Redux state is saved to Local Storage on each step for persistence.
3. The overview Step is complete with Desktop and Mobile View, identical to the source pdf.

Thank You!
